3 trading posts on ALTIS (with Trader- and Teleportpositions)
-------------------------------------------------------------

I've exchanged the standart Epoch trading posts with three of my own.

Features:
---------

  - 2-3 traders each compound.
  - Trading posts are safezones.
  - ATM's in the compounds.

You can use them with standart NPCTraders, as well with static HSBlackmarket traders.

Installation
------------
Update the altis.h (@EpochHive\addons\a3_epoch_server_settings\configs\map).

HSBlackmarket users also have to update the trader\init.sqf.

Have fun.
